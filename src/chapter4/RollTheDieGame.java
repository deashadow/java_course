/*
*The objective of this game is to travel the entire game board
* of 20 spaces within 5 die rolls.
Roll the die for the user (generate a Random number between 1 – 6)
* and advance the user that number of spaces on the game board.
* Here’s the code to do this ((import is java.util.Random):
* After each roll, tell the user which game space they are on
* and how many more spaces they have to go to win.
Repeat this 4 additional times, for 5 rolls in total.
However, if the user gets to 20 before 5 rolls, end the game
* - they’ve won.
If they are greater than or less than 20 spaces exactly, they lose.
Remember there are only 20 spaces on the board,
* so a message like “You advanced to space 22” is a bug.
